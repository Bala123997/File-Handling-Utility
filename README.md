# FileHandlingUtility üóÇüñ•

*Simple Java File Handling Utility* ‚Äî my first internship task at *Codetech IT Solutions*.  
This small console program demonstrates basic file operations in Java: create/overwrite, append, read, delete, rename, and replace text.

## Features ‚úÖ
- Create or overwrite a file (enter END on a new line to finish input)  
- Append text to an existing file  
- Read and print file contents to the console  
- Delete a file  
- Rename a file (with existence checks)  
- Replace text across a file's contents

FileUtility.java uses java.io.* and java.util.Scanner. The class is in package FileHandlingUtility.

## How to compile & run ‚ñ∂
From repository root (assuming files are in FileHandlingUtility/):

```bash
# Compile
javac FileHandlingUtility/FileUtility.java

# Run
java FileHandlingUtility.FileUtility
When the program runs you'll see a menu:
--- FILE HANDLING MENU ---
1. Create / Overwrite file
2. Append to file
3. Read file
4. Delete file
5. Rename file
6. Replace the text in file
0. Exit

Example usage
Choose option 1 to create a file named notes.txt and type lines; type END to stop.
Choose option 3 to read notes.txt.
Choose option 6 to replace occurrences of a word with another.

What I learned üéì
File I/O in Java: FileWriter, BufferedReader, FileReader, and File.
Handling exceptions (try/catch) for robust file operations.
Designing modular methods for each functionality.
User input handling with Scanner.
